# Introduction to the Well-Architected Framework
---
* Describe the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework
* Identify key principles for creating a solid architectural foundation

# Five Pillars
---
Memorize these five pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework:
1. Cost Optimization
2. Operational Excellence
3. Performance Efficiency
4. Reliability
5. Security

# Reliability
---
* The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
* Design for high availability and disaster recovery
* Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms

# Security
---
* Ensure your workloads are protected against threats
* Implement identity and access management
* Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
* Regularly update and patch systems
* CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
* Zero Trust Model: "Never trust, always verify"

# Cost Optimization
---
* Manage and optimize your cloud spending
* Use cost management tools to monitor and analyze expenses
* Right-size resources based on demand
* Implement budgeting and forecasting practices
* Bring Quality, speed and efficiency up while driving costs down

# Operational Excellence
---
* Focus on operations processes that keep your systems running smoothly
* Automate routine tasks and deployments
* Monitor system performance and health
* Unreliable workloads increase downtime and decrease user satisfaction

# Performance Efficiency
---

* Use resources efficiently to meet system requirements
* Scale resources up or down based on demand
* Choose the right resource types and sizes for your workloads
* Continuously monitor and optimize performance

# Tradeoffs
---
Building a workload that meets all five pillars can be challenging. Consider the following:
* Balancing the five pillars often involves tradeoffs
* Prioritize based on business needs and goals
* Example: Enhancing security may increase costs or impact performance
* Regularly review and adjust your architecture to maintain balance among the pillars
